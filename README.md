## Introduction

Cross-validation is a statistical technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. It involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets to test the model's performance on different sections of the data. This helps in understanding how well the model will perform on unseen data.

## Cross-Validation Techniques

### Hold-Out Cross-Validation

Splits the dataset into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

### K-Fold Cross-Validation

Divides the dataset into `k` equally sized folds. The model is trained `k` times, each time using `k-1` folds for training and the remaining fold for testing. The final performance metric is the average of the metrics obtained from each fold.

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

A special case of K-Fold Cross-Validation where `k` is set to the number of samples in the dataset. Each sample is used once as the test set while the remaining samples form the training set.

### Time Series Cross-Validation

Designed for time series data. It uses a rolling or expanding window approach to ensure that training always happens on past data and testing on future data.

## Code Examples

Code examples for each cross-validation technique are provided in the `examples` directory. Each example includes:

- Explanation of the technique
- Sample data generation
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics
